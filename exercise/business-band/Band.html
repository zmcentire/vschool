                <h2>Bio</h2>
                <p>Listening to the larger-than-life, but tight and precise blues-rock of The Blue Stones on their Entertainment One Music debut, Black Holes, 
                    it is astonishing to discover all that sound and fury is created by just two people.</p>

                <p>Guitarist/vocalist/lyricist Tarek Jafar and percussionist/backing vocalist Justin Tessier, 
                    have known each other since meeting as kids just across the Detroit River in their Canadian hometown of Windsor, Ontario. 
                    But it wasn’t until attending university together, that they decided to combine their talents into a musical project.
                </p>

                <p>The Blue Stones have an incredibly diverse palette of influences -- and although they’re a duo, it’s unfair to limit the comparisons just to The Black Keys 
                    and The White Stripes. The weight of Led Zeppelin, the grit of Hendrix and groove from hip-hop artists 
                    like J. Cole and Kanye are all there. But in an effort that’s unlike any other in contemporary rock, the result is something entirely unique to today’s musical landscape.
                </p>

                <p> From the slap back echo and the Rolling Stones’ “ooh-oohs” in the gut-punching “The Drop,” 
                    through the tribute to perseverance in the catchy, bluesy “Rolling with the Punches” and the acoustic-to-electric whisper-to-a-scream 
                    dynamism of the title track, Black Holes shows a band blasting into outer space and leaving “Solid Ground” behind. It’s the voyage of a group beginning to find its way, 
                    emerging from isolation and perspiration to inspiration, reaching an audience waiting to be tapped and entertained. An Alternative Blues Rock band fighting the good fight, 
                    looking to connect in an increasingly fragmented music universe.
                </p>

                <p> With the release of Black Holes, The Blue Stones are ready to raise the stakes and turn up the heat.</p>
